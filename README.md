# BreatheSpace

Hackathon project for the WCTD Hackathon 2025 with @m1c-dev and @the-cerealdev  
Project Work Started: 12/6/2025

## Analysis

The main problem we found through brainstorming with our AI partner Claude was the issue of proper education and health and well-being, SDG 4 and SDG 3. What we as a team came up with was a platform for mental health, mainly for students struggling with schoolwork and normal lives.

The first draft for the name of this app was '4u'.

Then we drafted up another name 'BreatheSpace'. The team agreed that this was a much better name than the previous draft, so we got to work on the design in Figma.

## Design

The design stage used [Figma](https://figma.com).

The color palette was created with our AI teammate Claude.
